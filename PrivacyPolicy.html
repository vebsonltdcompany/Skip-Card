    <h1>Skip Card — Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta">Effective date: November 13, 2025</p>

    <p>Thank you for playing <strong>Skip Card</strong>. We value your privacy and data protection. This Privacy Policy explains how (or if) we collect, use, store, and share your data, and what rights you have under applicable privacy laws such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>1. App Overview</h2>
      <p><strong>Skip Card</strong> is a fully offline single-player card game. The game runs entirely on your device, does not require internet access, and does not display ads or use any third-party analytics tools.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p><strong>We do not collect any personal data.</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>We do not collect your name, email address, device identifiers, location, or any personal information.</li>
        <li>We do not use third-party SDKs for analytics, advertising, or tracking.</li>
        <li>We do not collect telemetry or diagnostic data from your device.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you choose to manually share screenshots, gameplay, or files from your device, such sharing is entirely under your control and outside of our app’s operation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>3. App Permissions</h2>
      <p>The app requests only minimal permissions necessary for local gameplay. Because it operates entirely offline, it does not request access to sensitive data such as contacts, camera, microphone, or location.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>4. Third-Party Services & Links</h2>
      <p>The app does not include or interact with any third-party services, ad networks, or analytics providers. External links on the website (e.g., Google Play, GitHub) are provided for convenience; please review their respective privacy policies when you visit them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>This app is not directed toward children under 16. Since no personal data is collected, the game does not knowingly collect or store information from children.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>6. GDPR Compliance (EU Users)</h2>
      <p>Because we do not collect, process, or store any personal data, our GDPR obligations are minimal. However, we remain committed to the principles of transparency and privacy protection:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We respect user rights regarding data access and control, even though no data is collected.</li>
        <li>If any future version of the game introduces data collection or third-party services, we will update this policy and request user consent where required.</li>
      </ul>
